Highlights and conclusion
Most of the accomodations in NYC are in Brooklyn or Manhattan, and most of them are homes and apartments.
People could pay aproximately the same for a private room in Brooklyn and a shared room in Manhattan
There is no statistical difference in the median prices for accomodations in Queens, Staten Island and Bronx.
Manhattan has the most expensive accomodations and there are mostly homes and apartments to rent there.
Almost a quarter of homes/apt to rent are required to stay at least 2 nights, and 10% are required to stay 30 days.
Most hosts with more accomodations offer prices above $200 on average.
